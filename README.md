# 🍷 ML Project - Wine Quality Prediction  

## 🚀 Overview  
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Wine Quality Prediction** using the **Random Forest Classifier**. The model predicts the quality of wine based on key physicochemical properties such as **Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, and Alcohol**.  

An in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to understand feature correlations and their impact on wine quality.  

The trained **Random Forest model** achieved an impressive **accuracy of 93%**, showcasing its robustness in handling complex datasets.  

This project highlights the role of **Machine Learning in food and beverage quality assessment**, offering insights into production consistency and quality control.
