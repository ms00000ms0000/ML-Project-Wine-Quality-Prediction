# ML-Project-Wine-Quality-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Wine Quality Prediction** using the **Random Forest Classifier**. The model predicts the quality of wine based on key physicochemical properties such as **Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, and Alcohol**. An in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to understand feature correlations and their impact on wine quality. The trained Random Forest model achieved an impressive **accuracy of 93%**, showcasing its robustness in handling complex data. This project highlights the use of ML in **food and beverage quality assessment**.
